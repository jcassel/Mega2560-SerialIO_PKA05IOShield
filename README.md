# Mega2560-SerialIO_PKA05IOShield
General use serial controlled IO based on the Mega2560 with the PKA05Shield.  For use with OctoPrint with SerialIO Plugin.

Note that due to how the arduino Serial ports work, if you use the nanos USB connection for your Serial, it may(very likely) restart when you make a connection to it. Not an issue in most cases but you should be aware of this quark.
